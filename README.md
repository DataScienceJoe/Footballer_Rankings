# Footballer_Rankings

Football fans are often found having arguments about whether one player, at their peak, was better than another player at their peak. In order to best answer this question, I have collected together some data (from 2012 onwards) which may provide answers.

The data are from The Guardian's 100 Best Male Footballers of the Year, with ten years of rankings from 2012 to 2021 as voted for by their judges. This can only find peaks that happened in the past decade. If you disagree with any rankings, remember they chose them, not me!  
I've defined a peak as a player's highest average ranking over three consecutive years. For example, Messi was 1st, 1st, 2nd in 2012,13,14 = an average 2012-14 position of 1.333.   
166 players make the cut of having a recent and sustained peak -- many congratulations to you, if you happen to be one of those 166 elite footballers.

RawFootballerData.csv includes the input data collated from The Guardians data, main.ipynb is the Pandas code used to clean and calculate averages from the data, and further editing is done using Microsoft Excel in order to produce the end product, final_graphic.xlsx. 

P.s. While The Guardian do provide detailed spreadsheets, they definitely haven't realised how messy and incomplete they are... if you know anyone at The Guardian, you can let them know that I can give them cleaner and more complete versions of their spreadsheets to upload next year!
